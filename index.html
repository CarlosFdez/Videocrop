    A user interface application used to crop videos on keyframes without retranscoding to maintain quality,
    remuxing the video into an mp4. Its similar to one of Avidemux's use cases,
    but supports exporting multiple intervals simultaneously and comes with video playback features.
</p>

<p>
    Because it only cuts on keyframes, the cuts are not exact. The exported file will usually be slightly larger than the specified range.
</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
    To open a file, drag a video file to the open window.
</p>
<img src="images/example.png"/>
<p>
    Afterwards, you can edit the text field manually or use the Adjust Range buttons
    to update the ranges to export (indicated by blue boxes), and click the export button to export.
    It can support almost any input format, but the export is only to mp4.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
    A video is composed of a container consisting of several streams, where each stream is a video or audio track.
    What the application is replace the container for a new one and copy the desired segment of the stream. However,
    due to the format that most video streams are encoded, the segment is not exact, and will usually start before and end after the given range.
</p>
<p>To understand why the cuts are not exact, you would need to understand interframe compression.</p>
<p>
    This application is a frontend for <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>, and works under-the-hood by executing the following ffmpeg command for each export range:
</p>
<code>ffmpeg -ss <em>start</em> -i <em>input_file</em> -avoid_negative_ts make_zero -t <em>duration</em> -map 0 -codec copy <em>output_file</em></code>
